# Fizz Buzz
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. It is an algorithm (my first) for Fizz Buzz, a group word game for children to teach them about division. The program counts incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "fizzbuzz".

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Fizz Buzz.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*
