# Fizz Buzz
A simple C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz + Grub Academy. It is an algorithm for Fizz Buzz, a group word game for children to teach them about division. The program counts incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "fizzbuzz".

The code was written independently by me. The class provided only general instructions (see the comments inside Program.cs).

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Fizz Buzz.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*
