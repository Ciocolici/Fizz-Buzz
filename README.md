# Fizz-Buzz
A C# (CSharp) Console App project. This is an algorithm (my first) for Fizz buzz, a group word game for children to teach them about division. The program counts incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "fizzbuzz".

Open "Fizz Buzz.sln" to see the code. To run the Console App program directly, launch "Fizz Buzz.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".
